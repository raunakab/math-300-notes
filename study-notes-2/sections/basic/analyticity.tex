\begin{definition}[Function Analyticity]
    A function, $f:D\rightarrow Y$, is said to be analytical in the domain $D\subseteq\C$ iff it is differentiable at every point in $D$.
    \begin{align}
        \text{$f$ is analytical in $D$}&\\
            \iff\forall x\in D,&\ \text{$f$ is differentiable at $x$}
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
