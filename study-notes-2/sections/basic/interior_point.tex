\begin{definition}[Interior Point]
    A point, $x\in\C$, is considered an interior point of some set, $D\subseteq\C$, iff every point in its neighbourhood is an element of $D$.
    \begin{align}
        \text{$x$ is an interior point of $D$}\iff\exists\epsilon\in\R^+,\forall x'\in\neighbourhood(x,\epsilon),x'\in D
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
