\begin{definition}[Function Continuity]
    A function, $f:D\rightarrow Y$, is said to be continuous at the point $x\in D$ iff $f$ has a limit of $L\in Y$ at the point $x$, \textbf{and} $f(x)=L$.
    \begin{align}
        \text{$f$ is continuous at $x$}&\\
            \iff\bigg(
                &\text{$f$ has a limit of $L$ at $x$}
            \bigg)\land\bigg(
                f(x)=L
            \bigg)
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
