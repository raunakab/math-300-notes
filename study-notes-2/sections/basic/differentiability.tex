\begin{definition}[Function Differentiability]
    A function, $f:D\rightarrow Y$, is said to be differentiable at a point $x\in D$ iff the difference quotient of $f$ is continuous at $x$.
    \begin{align}
        \text{$f$ is differentiable at $x_0$}&\\
            \iff\bigg(
                &x\mapsto\lim_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
            \bigg)\text{ is continuous at $x_0$}
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
